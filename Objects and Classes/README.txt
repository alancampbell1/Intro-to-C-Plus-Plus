C++ Objects and Classes:

C++ allows you to bundle data and functions together as a self-contained unit called an Object.

A class is used to describe both the properties (data) and behaviours (functions) of objects. However, classes are not objects but used to instantiate/create an object.

The primary function of a class is to hold information.
This is achieved with attributes known as data members.
Member functions determine the behaviour of a class, i.e. contain a definition for supporting various operations on the data held.
