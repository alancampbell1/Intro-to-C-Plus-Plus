Introduction to C++:

C++ is a general-purpose, middle-level programming language with high and low level
Programming capabilities and also supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

C++ is considered an extension of C programming as programs written in C can run on 
C++ compilers.

C++ is used to create computer software. 
It is used to create the following:
- General Systems Software
- Drivers for various computer devices
- Software for servers and software for specific applications

There are 3 standard libraries in C++:
- C++ Core Language - contains the building blocks of C++ including data types, variables
And literals.
- C++ Standard Library - Rich set of methods for manipulating files and strings
- STL (Standard Template Library) provides a set of template classes for manipulating data 
structures.

All major C++ Compilers support the ANSI Standard. This stands for the American National
Standard Institute and is an attempt to ensure C++ code becomes portable, i.e. code written 
for Microsoft's compiler can run on a Mac Compiler.


To learn C++ you need to install the C++ compiler. A compiler is a computer program that 
transforms human readable source code (i.e. programming language we type) into another
computer language, aka Binary Code. This way the computer can understand what to do.

How to run and Compile in C++:

When you write a C++ program, save the extension as .cpp to an appropriate folder.
Next, navigate to that folder using the Mac Terminal.
Assuming the file is called example1.cpp, type the following in:

g++ example1.cpp -o example1.out

This will create a new .out file which contains the binary code for the PC to understand.
Next, type the following to run the code:

./example1.out


This will produce the output.
